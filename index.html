        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Njabulo Skondo — a first-year Information Technology student at Rosebank College with a passion for building digital experiences that connect people.
            My journey into tech started with a love for problem-solving and creativity, and web development quickly became my way to merge the two. Java development
            fascinates me because of its flexibility — from console-based logic to dynamic GUIs and interactive games. Alongside my academic focus on Business Systems,
            I’ve been sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, responsive design, API integration, and beginner-to-intermediate Java programming. Every project I work on is built
            with clean, well-structured, and well‑commented code, reflecting my belief that clarity in code leads to clarity in impact. My ultimate goal? To create solutions
            that not only work but uplift — applying tech as a tool for opportunity, innovation, and generational impact.
